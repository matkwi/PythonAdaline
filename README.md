# PythonAdaline
This project was created to show Machine Learning by Adaline algorithm. The app was written in python with tkinter and NumPy. First you need to press "Learn" button and then you can draw number or just choose it from listed ones. Next you can click "check" to see the result of the Neural Network. You can always press "Learn" several times to train it better but be careful not to over train it. On the right side you can see confidence in which algorithm guesses particular number. There are also buttons to manipulate the number by for example moving it.

Just download the project and compile it (python 3.7 will be the best for it).
